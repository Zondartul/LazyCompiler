//todo:
/*
* 
* 
* [Bug] initial values for the class members do not get set (have to manually write in a constructor)
* [bug] class methods can't fetch member variables (might be frameclimbing, or even lack of 'this' ptr)
* [buf] can't handle the expression &(scr.X)
* [Issue] superfluous skeleton code is generated in assembly (debug info)
* [Issue] too many comments in assembly 
* [Bug] (null) values for lbl_to in debug info of some symbols
* [Issue] lots of repeated code in semantic_analyze of operators
* [Todo] display the source code location during semantic errors
