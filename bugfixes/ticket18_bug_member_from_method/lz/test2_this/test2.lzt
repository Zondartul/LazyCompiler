// * [bug 18] class methods can't fetch member variables (might be frameclimbing, or even lack of 'this' ptr)
// *  \[bug] variables and functions don't know they have a "this" symbol
// *    \[bug?] semantic_flatten is in effect so the STs for individual structures are missing
// *      \[issue] not sure how tightly coupled the codegen is, does it need the symbol table or not?
// *        \[issue] does code gen even read aout_IR? Where does it get the IR?
